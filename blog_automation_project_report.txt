Blog Automation Project Report

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project automates the process of generating and publishing blog posts on Medium using a combination of:
- OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation.
- DALLÂ·E or other image generators for creating blog images.
- Selenium for automating the browser to log in and post to Medium.
- MySQL for optional data management.
- Hosted on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instance.

Current Progress:
-----------------
1. AWS EC2 Instance Setup:
- Launched Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS on a t2.micro instance in AWS EC2.
- Instance State: The instance is currently stopped.
- SSH Access was established using a key pair (MediumKeyPair.pem).
- MySQL was installed and configured on the instance, but is optional at this stage.

2. Python Environment Setup:
- Created a Python virtual environment (myenv) to manage dependencies:
  ```
  python3 -m venv myenv
  ```
- Installed necessary Python packages:
  - selenium (for browser automation).
  - openai (for GPT-4 API integration).
  - mysql-connector-python (for MySQL integration).

3. Python Script (automate_blog.py):
- The script automates the following:
  - Content generation using GPT-4 (pending API key).
  - Blog posting on Medium via Selenium.
  - Image generation (planned but not yet implemented).
  
- Pending Task: Obtain an OpenAI API key and update the script:
  ```
  openai.api_key = 'your-real-api-key'
  ```

4. Browser Automation (Chrome & ChromeDriver):
- Installed Google Chrome and ChromeDriver, but encountered version mismatch errors:
  - ChromeDriver version 114.0 and Chrome version 128.0 are incompatible.
  
- Next Step: Fix the version mismatch by either downgrading Chrome or upgrading ChromeDriver.

5. Automation Setup (cron jobs):
- Cron job setup is planned to run the script at regular intervals but has not been configured yet.

Errors & Roadblocks:
---------------------
1. MySQL Connector Error: Resolved by installing mysql-connector-python.
2. ChromeDriver Version Mismatch: ChromeDriver version 114.0 not compatible with Chrome version 128.0.
3. OpenAI API Key: The GPT-4 subscription doesn't provide API access; you need to sign up for an OpenAI API account.

Next Steps:
------------
1. Restart the EC2 instance and reconnect via SSH.
2. Fix ChromeDriver version mismatch by downgrading Chrome or upgrading ChromeDriver.
3. Obtain OpenAI API Key and integrate it into the script.
4. Test the Python script to ensure it generates and publishes blogs correctly.
5. Set up a cron job to run the script at regular intervals.
6. Optionally, configure MySQL for logging data or storing blog-related information.
